# Terminal

These are my personal terminal settings.

I wouldn't recommend to use it as it is for your project. It's not documented.
It's just a collection files and configurations, that i use in my projects.


## How to install

```
sh init
```

## Tools that should be set up on a zyklop-machine

mysql

```
bash <(curl -Ls http://git.io/eUx7rg)
```

show hidden files in finder

```
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
```
