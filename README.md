# Terminal

These are my personal terminal settings.

I wouldn't recommend to use it as it is for your project. It's not documented.
It's just a collection files and configurations, that i use in my projects.

## Requirements

You have to install OSX command line tools manualy :(

## How to install

```
sh init
```
